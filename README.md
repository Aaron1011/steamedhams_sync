# Synchronized video generator

This repository generates a 'synchronized video', composed of multiple side-by-side copies of one input video.
The videos play at different speeds, starting at different times, such that they all sync up briefly at a particular moment in time.

For this to run in any reasonable amount of time, you'll need
1. ~2 GB of free memory
2. [My fork of moviepy](https://github.com/Aaron1011/moviepy/tree/buffer_memory)
